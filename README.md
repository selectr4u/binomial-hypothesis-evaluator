# Binomial Hypothesis Evaluator

made this based on what i just learnt in a level maths about hypothesis testing

to run it simply just use a lua interpreter (preferrably >5.4?) to run it and follow the prompts given to you

it should be accurate in what it's doing (hopefully i've interpreted how binomial hypothesis testing works correctly)
